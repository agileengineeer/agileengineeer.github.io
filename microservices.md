# Exploring the Depths of Microservices Architecture: Trends, Patterns, and Best Practices

## Abstract
This paper delves into the microservices architectural style, a method of developing software systems that emphasizes modular, independently deployable services. We explore its advantages, challenges, and compare it with traditional monolithic architectures, shedding light on its growing relevance in the modern technological landscape. We will talk about various different pattern in micro services and their usage, an ideal choices for building applications with Micro Services.
